; Public URLs to the image server endpoints

; These must be overridden to point to the image server.  They may be set to
; the same value, but they're kept apart to allow for having static thumbnails,
; thumbnail caching separated from resize caching, etc.  Thumbnails are a much
; smaller subset of possible images and therefore benefit a great deal from
; being cached and/or pregenerated.
