# Docker Instructions

For development, Docker Compose is the only supported approach to ensure
developers are running a consistent environment, including the precise Apache
configuration, application versions, etc.

For information about installing / reinstalling / testing pull requests with Docker, see [Installation](/docs/docker/install.md).

For a convenient reference list of Docker commands such as managing batches, containers, and images, see [Quick Reference](/docs/docker/reference.md).
