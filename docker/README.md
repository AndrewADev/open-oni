Open ONI In Docker
===============

See [our Open ONI docker
page](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/wiki/Docker-Setup-OS-X) on the wiki
for our full Docker instructions.

For manual installation, please use [`dev.sh`](dev.sh) as a template for
customizations.  We can't support users who choose not to use that script,
however, as there are too many variables when running a slightly different
stack than the core Open ONI team.
